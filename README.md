New Relic Infrastructure helps you to monitor your entire infrastructure - hosts, cloud providers, container services, backend services, orchestrators, and more.

This repo contains a couple of helper scripts and resources to deploy and manage the New Relic Infrastructure agent and other third-party services such as database management systems.
